# Todos:
- give pictures of all the different things on the menu, so if they ask what is 
sabudana vada, it gives a picture

- after the order is placed, it should tell ask if there is anything else you like to say about
the order, if no then place the order, and give your own prices including gst for all items on
the menu

- if the user says no oil, or less spicy or some specification it should detect it

## End Goal:

- It should take the order with the specifications
- ask for confirmation before placing the order

after these two, start with the front end


## Could implement:

- stores all the orders, and then tells the user this is the most ordererd thing with say dosa, and asks
would you like to order it ?

- then a window of razorpay or some payment should be shown(this is hard to implement, but do able). the bill shown should consist of the bill, and then a qr code below where they can pay the money.
